1. Start writing paper
2. Learn about Active Learning (data point contributions to accuracy and bias)
3. Fit exponential curve on results:

Bias = k * exp(lambda * Accuracy)
log(Bias) = log(k) + (lambda * Accuracy)

log(Bias) = log(k) + (lambda * Accuracy) + e
for every (ML Model, Imputation Method, Dataset)

find e vector, and lambda vector

sum(e^2) = fit metric
