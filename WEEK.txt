equal opportunity to be sentenced when you are innocent

Pr(AA is labeled as low risk when he is actually high risk) =
Pr(Caucasian is labeled as low risk when actually high risk) 
Pr(AA is labeled as high risk when he is low risk) = 
Pr(Caucasian is labeled as high risk when actually low risk)
bias = |LHS - RHS|
A*|LHS - RHS of first type| + B*|LHS - RHS of second type|
