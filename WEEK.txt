For each value in the test set, we want to know:
1. If we used imputation to fill in this value (instead of knowing the true value), how would that affect the prediction?
2. How would it affect the fairness overall?

For each value in the training set, we want to know:
1. If we replaced a particular value with an imputed value, how would that affect the accuracy and fairness of the model as a whole?
