1. create dataframe with several columns (proportion of missing data, iteration num, model, bias1, bias2, acc, f1 score)
linear regression, f1 score is target, regressed on one bias, controlling for the models as dummy variables, get a coefficient on bias
a 1 unit increase in bias is associated with a beta change in f1 score, on average, controlling for the choice of ML model
a 1 unit decrease in bias is associated with a negative beta change in f1 score, on average, controlling for the choice of ML model

y = bx + c + delta1*model (True or False)

2. read paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12728.pdf
3. > 100 trials
4. add titanic dataset
