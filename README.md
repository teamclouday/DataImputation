# Data Imputation Research  

In the process of machine learning, input data always plays an essential role in the model training  
However, real world data is usually not perfect. Very often part of the dataset is missing.  
This repo is created to research on different methods of data replacing and guessing, and their according effect to several well-known machine learning algorithms.

### Main Variables  
1. The methods of generating missing data entries  
2. The methods of guessing a missing data entry  
3. Different machine learning algorithms to test on  

------

### Datasets
1. [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) (UCI)  
2. [Bank Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) (UCI)  
3. [Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) (UCI)
